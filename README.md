# mandelbrot
Creating images of the Mandelbrot set with advanced coloring techniques
The simplest way to have a coloured image is to specify a color depending on the "escape time", 
that is to say on the number of iterations needed for the z_n sequence to reach a modulus greater than 2.
With some advanced coloring techniques one can smooth the colors when we are very close to the mandelbroot set.
These techniques are well known and a good description can be found on the personal website of Arnaud Cheritat, 
A French researcher.
